# Zinc Usage

Compiler Flags
Zinc has a lot of compiler flags that can be used to customize the behavior of the compiler. These flags can be passed to the compiler using the `-<flag>` syntax.

Here is an example of how to use a compiler flag:
```
zinc --version
```
In this example, the `--version` flag is used to display the version of the Zinc compiler, plus some other information.

**Output**
```
$ zinc --version
zinc (ZINC) 0.0.1-pre 2025040713
